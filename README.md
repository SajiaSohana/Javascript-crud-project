##It's a Complete CRUD project including Pagination, Filter data option, Controlling Table Size, Count table data etc.
To design Table, New user button, Modal, Form I used only CSS3. To make it functional, I  used only Vanilla JavaScript. and for saving the data I used JavaScript Local Storage. You can read the data, You can update the data, You can delete the data. You can upload image also in the local storage and can show this image in the table.
